Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
An artificial intelligence–based adaptive mathematics learning system that models student knowledge through response analysis, error patterns, and temporal dynamics. It generates personalized learning paths for remediation, consolidation, enrichment, and intensive exam preparation, supporting data-informed pedagogical decisions.

## Background

*Lack of personalized diagnosis in mathematics learning. Many students fail or struggle in mathematics because specific conceptual or procedural difficulties are not identified early. This problem is very common in secondary education, where assessment focuses on final results rather than learning processes.

*Inefficient and generic remediation strategies. Traditional reinforcement activities are usually uniform for all students, regardless of their actual needs. This leads to wasted study time and limited improvement, especially in large or heterogeneous classrooms.

*Poor use of assessment data. Student responses, error patterns, and timing data are rarely analyzed in depth, despite containing valuable information about learning gaps. This represents a missed opportunity to support data-informed teaching.

*High anxiety and low efficiency in exam preparation. Many students need to prepare mathematics exams in short time frames without clear guidance on what content is essential. This situation is frequent in recovery exams and contributes to stress and poor outcomes.

*Personal motivation. As an educator, I observe daily that students with similar grades often have very different underlying difficulties. I am motivated to design a system that helps diagnose these differences and supports both students and teachers with actionable insights.

*Importance of the topic. Mathematics is a foundational subject with strong cumulative dependencies. Improving how mathematical understanding is diagnosed and supported can significantly impact academic success, equity in education, and long-term access to STEM pathways.


## How is it used?

The solution is used as an adaptive learning tool in mathematics, both in the classroom and for independent study at home. Students interact by solving digital exercises, while the system analyzes their answers, times, and error patterns to estimate their level of mastery of each concept.

Based on this analysis, the AI ​​generates personalized learning paths, adjusting the pace, difficulty, and type of activities (reinforcement, consolidation, or extension). The tool is especially useful in contexts of continuous assessment, content review, and intensive exam preparation in short periods of time.

The main users are secondary and high school students and teachers. Considerations must include the diversity of learning paces, the clarity of feedback for students, the interpretability of data for teachers, and respect for the privacy of educational information.
